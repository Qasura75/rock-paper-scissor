# rock-paper-scissor
In this project we are going to code a simple rock-paper-scissor game that you can play with the computer

------------------------------------------------------

Pseudocode:
Get the input from the user (can be rock, paper or scissor)
Save Input in a variable 
Get Input from Computer (can be rock, paper or scissor)

Take the user input and the computer input
If the scenario(User: Stone - PC:Scissor) = Won
If the scenario(User: Scissor - PC:Paper) = Won
If the scenario(User: Paper - PC:Stone) = Won
If both get the same item = Tie
Otherwise = Lost

In the function game() we play 5 round with a loop
After 5 rounds the function sees who has more score and declares the winner

What I have learnt:
- Loops
- How to correctly use return
- When to use const variables
- How to write Pseudocode
- How to comment on the project
